This repository is a general space for snippets that I (Kevin O. Avignon) use in public appearances.

It will include sample code from talks, slides, and potentially code used in blog posts.

Each top-level directory generally represents a post or a talk; subdirectories will specify Code, Slides, Notes etc if appropriate.

All code is released under the Apache License 2.0, as found in the LICENSE file.
